A Windows or OS X executable of this game can be sent upon request. 

You may also open up this project in Unity. This may be done by using UnityHub to "Add" the project folder, or by clicking on the Scene file in the Asset folder, with Unity installed. I imagine it will work on most versions of Unity, but I used 2020.3.26f1

# Additional Features
There were some differing opinions on Blackjack rules, so I tried to adhere to those laid out by Bicycle Cards. 

## Betting
The player sets a bet amount by clicking on the four poker chips on the bottom left of the screen. The bet amount can be set to 0 by clicking the "clear" button. Once a desired amount is selected, the player may click the "PLACE BET" button to play through a round of Blackjack. A Blackjack pays 3:2. 

## Double Down
If the player's first two cards can add up to 9, 10, or 11 the player is given the option to "double down." This doubles the player's bet, and he or she receives one additional card before a winner is determined.

## Insurance
If the house's face up card is an Ace, the player may wager up to half of their initial bet that the hole is a 10-card. 

## Splitting
If the player's first two cards are of the same denomination, the player may click a transparent copy of the second card to start a new hand. The player then plays out the first hand normally, and busting or clicking the "STAND" button will begin the second hand. According to my understanding of the Bicycle rules, they do not allow double downs on splits, and you may not split multiple times.
